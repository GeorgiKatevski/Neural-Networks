**Weather Forecasting Project**

**Overview**

This project involves solving three distinct tasks related to weather forecasting using a dataset provided in weather_classification_data.csv. The tasks include:

Forecasting: Predicting weather-related numerical values.

Classification: Categorizing data into text categories or numerical intervals.

Clustering: Grouping similar data points together, with a focus on deep learning methods but also exploring other machine learning techniques.

**Forecasting**

Description
The forecasting task involves predicting numerical weather-related values such as temperature. The goal is to create a model that can provide accurate forecasts based on historical weather data.


**Classification**

Description

The classification task involves categorizing weather data into specific categories or numerical intervals. This could include classifying days as 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy', or assigning temperature ranges.

**Clustering**

Description

The clustering task involves grouping similar weather data points together. This is primarily aimed at identifying patterns or clusters in the data which can be used for further analysis or forecasting.

**Dataset**

The dataset weather_classification_data.csv contains historical weather data that will be used for all three tasks. The dataset includes various features such as temperature, humidity, seasons and more.
